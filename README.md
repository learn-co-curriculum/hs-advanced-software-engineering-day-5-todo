## Welcome to Day 5!!!

Today, we'll be enabling user sessions to allow for authentication and authorization. Once a user logs in, we can allow them to post content and automatically associate it with them. For this morning's ToDo:

1. Spend some time debugging your application from yesterday. Adding a user model makes our applications infinitely more complex - if you're still getting errors, that's okay! Focus on your Social Media project first, then move on to Fwitter if you have time. Use the completed version of Fwitter as a guide - you can always clone from that for today's lesson if you don't have time to update it. 

2. Once you've updated Fwitter and your Group project, get more ActiveRecord Associations practice with the Tumblr Associations lab. You'll be setting up tables, models, and relationships for users, posts, and comments!.
